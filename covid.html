        <h2>The Honolulu Zombie Run 5k - October 31st 2021 </h2>
        <p class="covid-info">The expectation is that the Honolulu Zombie Run 5k will be delivered in its usual format
            and on its normal race course with changes to start line procedures for better participant spacing, aid
            stations, packet pickup, and post-race operations and gatherings. Details of these technical safety measures
            will be made available at honoluluzombierun.com . Registration for the race will focus on the race’s
            traditional Hawaii state market area in order to limit participation from outside these areas.</p>
        <p class="covid-info">If we can’t deliver the race in its normal format on October 31st, we are developing a
            December 2021 contingency date for these races. That said, we are optimistic that vaccine and rapid-testing
            developments, reduced field size, spacing and hygiene safety measures will allow us to conduct safe and fun
            races on our normal race courses on the May dates. We are not currently considering a virtual format for the
            Marathon.</p>
